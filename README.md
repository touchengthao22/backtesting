# Trading Day Trend Explorer

**Trading Day Trend Explorer** is a personal, hobby project to learn how to **analyze and manipulate stock data** using Python and Yahoo Finance. Everything is **work in progress**, and this project is purely for **educational purposes**—no real trading or financial advice intended.

## Overview

This project explores trends in stock prices by comparing recent closing prices with prices from previous trading days. It’s designed to help you practice:

- Working with **pandas** and time-series data.  
- Handling **missing data** like weekends or market holidays.  
- Testing **logical conditions** to detect potential uptrends or downtrends.  
- Tracking hypothetical **BUY** and **SELL** signals for analysis and learning.

## Purpose

- **Learn Python data manipulation** with real market data.  
- **Experiment with trends** in a risk-free, educational environment.  
- **Understand how conditions can be combined** to analyze stock movements.  
- **Have fun exploring** financial data in a structured way.
